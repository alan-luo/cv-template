# A Clean and Modular CV Template

Here's an HTML CV template for anyone to use. You can find a Dummy version [here](https://alan-luo.github.io/cv-template/), hosted on Github Pages.

It's almost exactly the same CSS as I use on my own site, for my CV, which you'll find [here.](http://alanluo.com/?cv)
